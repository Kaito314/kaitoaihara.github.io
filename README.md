# kaitoaihara.github.io

This is my personal website hosted on Github Pages. 
The purpose of this website is to have a personal landing page, and links to various social networks such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Github, and other contact information such as email address. 
There will also be a section about myself, and links to my resume and other stuff.
